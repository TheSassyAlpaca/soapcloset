			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
			<span>Effective Date: January 1st, 2019</span>
			<span>This privacy notice discloses the privacy practices for The Soap Closet and The Sassy Alpaca, LLC and our website; https://soapcloset.thesassyalpaca.com. This privacy notice applies solely to information collected by this website, except where stated otherwise. It will notify you of the following:</span>
			<span>What information we collect;</span>
			<span>With whom it is shared;</span>
			<span>How it can be corrected;</span>
			<span>How it is secured;</span>
			<span>How policy changes will be communicated; and</span>
			<span>How to address concerns over misuse of personal data.</span>
			<h2>Information Collection, Use, and Sharing </h2>
			<span>We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We only have access to/collect information that you voluntarily give us via email or other direct contact from you. We will not sell or rent this information to anyone. </span>
			<span>We will use your information to respond to you regarding the reason you contacted us. We will not share your information with any third party outside of our organization, other than as necessary to fulfill your request, e.g., to ship an order.</span>
			<span>Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to tell you about specials, new products or services, or changes to this privacy policy. </span>
			<h2>Your Access to and Control Over Information</h2>
			<span>You may opt out of any future contacts from us at any time. You can do the following at any time by contacting us via the email address or phone number provided on our website:</span>
			<span>See what data we have about you, if any.</span>
			<span>Change/correct any data we have about you.</span>
			<span>Have us delete any data we have about you.</span>
			<span>Express any concern you have about our use of your data</span>
			<span>You may also disconnect your Google account from The Soap Closet at: https://myaccount.google.com/permissions</span>
			<h2>Registration</h2>
			<span>In order to use this website, a user must first login with a Google account or a Facebook account. During registration Google/Facebook provides us with basic information (such as name and email address). This information is used to contact you about the products/services on our site in which you have expressed interest. We do not collect demographic data such as age, race, location, etc.</span>
			<h2>Orders</h2>
			<span>We do not take any form of orders nor do we, at this time, charge any kind of fee for access to our site. We do, however, accept product inquiries and order requests.</span>
			<h2>Sharing</h2>
			<span>We share aggregated metrics (total sales and indications of interest) with our locally sourced partners. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.</span>
			<h2>Security </h2>
			<span>We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline.</span>
			<span>Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the web page.</span>
			<span>While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (e.g. billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers on which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.</span>
			<h2>Cookies </h2>
			<span>We use "cookies" on this site. Your browser may cache certain files - this is out of our control.</span>
			<h2>Links </h2>
			<span>This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of any other site that collects personally identifiable information.</span>
			<h2>Notification of Changes</h2>
			<span>Whenever material changes are made to the privacy notice you will be notified by email.</span>
			<h2>Final Notice</h2>
			<span>If you feel that we are not abiding by this privacy policy, you should contact us immediately via email at info@thesassyalpaca.com.</span>
