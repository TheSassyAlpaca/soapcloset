					<h1>What Makes Goat Milk Soap So Good?</h1>
					<div>
						When I first started working with soap thirty some odd years ago goat milk soap was already a big deal. Back then, it didn’t matter what it looked like or even what it smelled like. If it had goat milk, it was gold. But there has always been a lot of misconceptions about what goat milk soap is, and what makes it so good. So what is it?
					</div>
					<h2>What Makes Soap <i>Goat Milk Soap?</i></h2>
					<div>
						Soap is the result of mixing lye (usually sodium hydroxide, but ash can also do the trick) and fats (anything from animal fats, vegetable oils, and nut butters - yes, even peanut butter). The lye is usually dissolved in ‘water’, making it easier to mix with the fats. Once mixed, this ‘soap batter’ is poured into molds or onto a flat source (kinda like pancakes) to set. Later, the soap is removed from its mold and left to ‘cure’ where the ‘water’ used to dissolve the lye is removed from the soap.
					</div>
					<div>
						So what makes soap goat milk soap? Most people assume that goat milk is one of the fats, but like all milk <i>goat milk is actually water</i>, at least 88% of it is. By replacing the ‘water’ in the soap making process with goat milk the soap becomes goat milk soap. Then, as mentioned above, the soap is cured and the ‘water’ is removed. By that I mean the 88% of the goat milk that is water evaporates and contributes nothing to the soap.
					</div>
					<div>
						So how much goat milk is actually in a bar of soap? Not much. If we take 100 ounces of ingredients: lye makes up about 11 ounces; water makes up about 23 ounces; and fats make up about 66 ounces. The 11 ounces of lye and 66 ounces of fats are transformed (saponified) and are now 77 ounces of soap. The water is gone. In goat milk soap, less than 12% of the ‘water’ remains, meaning that our 77 ounces of soap is now about 80 ounces of soap, 3 ounces being the result of the goat milk. Of that, about .75 ounces (less than 1%) is made up of the fats and oils in goat milk - this is the actual ‘goat milk soap’. 
					</div>
					<div>
						The remaining 2.25 ounces from the goat milk is evenly divided between sugars, proteins, and vitamins and minerals such as calcium, and vitamins A and D. They are the parts of the goat milk that creates the rich, creamy lather people expect from their goat milk experience.
					</div>
					<div class="blogBanner" style="background-image:url(/images/products/blueberryhill2.JPG);"></div>
					<h2>So Why Are Goat Milk Soaps Different?</h2>
					<div>
						Not all goat milk soaps are created equal. While most people think this is the result of the quality of the milk (which certainly plays a role) the real difference has to do with the fats and the ‘extra’ ingredients. Remember, the fats used in the soap make up over 96% of the soap (far more if the soap is ‘superfatted’) so naturally they would play a hefty role in the soap’s performance. The extras I mentioned can be all manner of things.
					</div>
					<h3>Fats</h3>
					<div>
						There are dozens of fats and oils used to make soap. Some are better than others, some simply bring different qualities to a soap. That fat make-up of a soap is a matter of preference as opposed to ‘right or wrong’. The fats determine if the bar is ‘hard’ (long-lasting), conditioning (pecan oil, shea butter), cleansing (coconut oil is the standard for a high cleansing rating), or has a creamy lather (coconut oil and shea butter). 
					</div>
					<h3>Extras</h3>
					<div>
						There are all manner of things that can be added to soap to change the way it behaves. Some bad, some good. For me, if it doesn’t provide some benefit to the soap’s performance or nourish the skin in some way then it is bad. This includes a number of common ingredients like: mica or muscovite, oxides, lakes, fragrance/parfum/perfume, FD&C colors, glitter, and precious metal shavings. Some of these are simply useless and added only for color while others are <a href="https://www.thesassyalpaca.com/blog/why-we-say-no-to-mica/" target="_self">truly horrific such as mica</a>.
					</div>
					<div class="blogBanner" style="background-image:url(/images/ingredients/dehydratedfruit.jpg);"></div>
					<div>
						Some beneficial ingredients include: honey (hardens the bar and improves lather), oats (exfoliates, believed to soothe eczema and psoriasis), tree barks (exfoliant with anti-aging properties), numerous herbs (peppermint, green tea leaves, jasmine buds, rose, rosemary, eucalyptus, chamomile, hibiscus, lavender, etc.), ground bean and nut shells (coffee beans and pecan shells exfoliate and give the skin a healthy glow), activated charcoal (still on the fence about this one, clearly not for everyone), kaolin (as well as other ‘dirts’ and clays - believed to pull toxins from the skin and soak up excess oil), and dehydrated fruit body (exfoliant, improve skin’s production of natural oil, moisturizes with natural fruit oils, anti-fungal/bacterial/microbial properties, may reduce pH of soap).
					</div>
					<div>
						What makes extras extra is that they add something of value. There is no value in adding glitter and pretty swirling color patterns to a soap that is just gonna get rubbed on someone’s butt…
					</div>
					<h2>..that didn’t answer my question.</h2>
					<div>
						Well, chances are it isn’t the goat milk. Goat milk has a number of beneficial properties, in fact goat milk seems to be made exclusively of ‘good stuff’ but there is so little of it in the milk, and only so much goat milk that can be incorporated into a soap recipe, that it is hard to say that goat milk plays a measurable role in a soaps overall quality. For me, what makes goat milk soap so good is 90% everything else and 10% the <i>belief</i> that it is better, or as it is better known, Marketing. After all, I have not encountered a single person that can tell the difference between my goat milk soap and my vegan soap and, with the obvious exception of goat milk, they are identical. So next time you are picking up a bar of goat milk soap ask “what’s in it, and why?”.
